# political-economy-basics

**life is just too mysterious, ideally writing slience would have been appropriate<br>
In this repo, I am writing about how can I see life as it is,<br>
I want to explain how everything happens <br>
how our tendencies and inclinations to do something but not otherthings, form,<br>
What is our origin, we start by seeing from the current moment and ,<br>
logically connect the entire way of scientific thinking and spiritual thinking <br>
staring from orgin of life , to the  experimentally most varified theory of physics, <br>
,we also tackle the main question, which is how do we live  right now <br>
given all the we know and don't know and not even sure if asking right questions<br>
how do we find the meaning , morality and so on <br>
how is our identity and values are formed,<br>
how that leads to a formation of particular society and economy<br>
how these structure reinforece themselves,<br>
how to see them and break free from them,<br>
and this repo is mostly about analysis, <br>
I don't know if analysis has any value in living <br>
or just the waste of time, but nonetheless I am going  to share thoughts**<br>
