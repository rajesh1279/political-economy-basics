# political-economy-basics

**There is just so much suffering in the world that don't need to exist, <br>
In this repo, I am writing about how can our miserable life be  made better, ways to do this <br>
I want to explain how everything happens, <br>
how our tendencies and inclinations to do something but not other form,<br>
What is our origin, we start by seeing from the current moment and logically connect the entire way of scientific thinking and spiritual thinking <br>
staring from orgin of life , to the  experimentally most varified theory of physics, <br>
,we also tackle the main question, which is how do we live  right now <br>
given all the we know and don't know and not even sure if asking right questions<br>
how do we find the meaning , morality and so on <br>
how is our identity and values are formed,<br>
how that leads to a formation of particular society and economy<br>
how these structure reinforece themselves,<br>
how to see them and break free from them,<br>
and this repo is just not about  analysis, but real change that can be made right now,<br>
As beloved marx once had said" philosopher only interpret the world, but point is to change it " <br>
if interested,  lets discuss plans , pros and cons and get into action**<br>
