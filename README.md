# political-economy-basics

**There is just so much suffering in the world that don't need to exist, 
   In this repo, I am writing about how can our miserable life be  made better, ways to do this 
I want to explain how everything happens, 
how our tendencies and inclication to do something but not other form,
What is our origin, we start by seeing from the current moment and logically connect the entire way of scientific thinking and spiritual thinking 
staring from orgin of life , to the  experimentally most varified theory of physics, 
,we also tackle the main question, which is how do we live  right now 
given all the we know and don't know and not even sure if asking right questions
how do we find the meaning , morality and so on 
how is our identity and values are formed,
how that leads to a formation of particular society and economy
how these structure reinforece themselves,
how to see them and break free from them,
and this repo is just not about  analysis, but real change that can be made right now,
As beloved marx once had said" philosopher only interpret the world, but point is to change it " 
if interested,  lets discuss plans , pros and cons and get into action**
