Origin of morality, 
Imagine the ant,  I can crush it with no consequence.
We are deeply cruel  creature we have potential for great compassion as well 
As great cruelty , great fear and fearlessness 
What we do together, is final call of the nature 
If we decide,  to kill each other make each others life miserable  
Not just our own bt every living creature, 
So is the reality , there is no reality beyond that, 

If we act compassionately so is the reality, 

Whether we live  for 1 sec or essentially immortal, 
What we do,  is the only reality, that is  happening 

Value of action that is happening in this moment can’t be undermined 
Whether we are one day to live or eternity to live,  


Everyone  and everything happens just once and become part of the universal flow, 
It is unchangeable literally, it becomes eternal, 

Saying that we should think before doing is correct 
And incorrect at the same time, so I won’t discuss that 

It is about seeing the totality of existance.

These qualities are in us, 
Just like our hands  and eyes, though they can’t be seen, 

We are born with  these qualities, 
Depending on our circumstances we suppress, 
Our sensitivity to these qualities, in order to survive, 


Given that there is indeed no right and wrong, 
Given that I am all powerful in this moment, 
Given that I don’t fear absolutely the consequence of my action 
Given that I absolutely have no reason , to not kill an ant 
Given that an  ant is so powerless compared to me,
So insignificant compared to me, 
So insignificant that it get crushed I don’t even notice, 
There is no guilt of any short 
When it has happened 
Given that there has been many times before
I have crushed ant knowingly 
And that too for fun
Given that there had been many times 
That I cutted her body to see, how it work 
Given that I have ended her existence 
Many times before, with great cruelty,
I am also aware that an ant does not have very long life 
And if I am not, some other animal , or some else would crush it 
With no fuss whatsoever,very unceremoniously  
I am aware that I have  nothing to achieve either by letting go or killing it 

Given I have never given so much thought on my actions 
But this time, I am just thinking of killing , 
Thinking of utter domination, 
Give me tears, literally , as I am writing it 



I choose to not kill the ant, 
Because she is just so beautiful, 
She is unaware of calamities  far higher than her existence, 
May be she is, 
I am not interested in crushing her, 
It is just amazing to see an ant moving, 
I am aware of aware of the extraordinary beauty of her little existence 
This  sensitivity my dear friends is basis of morality 
This goes  beyond good and bad, 
This goes beyond  fear, guilt or happiness or knowledge 

In fact sometime, I would let ant eat myself, 
So that the she could survive, 
I would like to end my existence, 
So that she( ant ) can have some more moment of existence 

Anyways ant has to end  one day, 
Not with much fanfare, as I am giving her, 
Which she did not ask for, 

Anyways her existence will end , why be so bothered to be in such a hurry to end it 
Why put effort in ending something, which is going to end anyway,

I think,no no ,  I don’t think , it is happening to me right now, this sensitivity is what gives us morality 
This sensitivity comes naturally 
Those who have it, just can’t ignore it, 
They have no choice but to act in accordance, 

This sensitivity is our great assest, 
this senstivity to see the beauty of all big and small, 
There is no way to avoid this sensitivity, 


for so long I had been vegetarian like 26 27 years, initially through culture and then through this realisation,  I can't  overstate what impact  this realisation had on me.
More I look closely, exploitation is really everywhere, morderen economy is built on the principle of maximum exploitation. there js no avoiding it if not in food then in shelter medicine,clothes road, and exploitation of natural resource in general, and frankly I am selfish and I don't want to go to stone age,but this is false dichotomy, no one has to go that far to prevent exploitation. More closure look reveals that as much as we including me exploitation nature,we exploit ourselves I'm various ways by constant demands physically and psychological. For me personally, it had got to a point of madness. bt it is not rare at all.
there is another sticky point, nature loves to kill sooner or later, there is equally cruel aspect of beauty, utter dominantation, utter ending of every living thing, and it really does not matter how something ends, so why not end in my stomach. this is argument many use which is actually totally correct but are they living in peace. I think one can't live peace even knowing this, our innate sense of compassion won't let us live in satisfaction.
so a different outlook on nature of exploitation is needed, here is how I have thought it, When we do anything more than we need, and since nobody is there to stop us. this is exploitation, this is not a direction of minimalism, but we must be honest in what we really need, and to know what one needs, one must be very in tune with their mind body,
