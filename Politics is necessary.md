# Learning about politics is necessary 
Lot of smart people who have real life experience, like scientist and researcher directly working on soical problem, social aid poeple, ngo, 
charites and trust,
I would argue even the religious organisisation, whoever can engage the public should join politics 
these are the poeple best suited to do politics, as they are smart and know how  to communicate poeple  in language 
## reasons 
### politics is everywhere, it influence life almost everyday
### impact of politics on larger time scale like a  5 years or 10 years have difference like day and night 
### politics is about letting everyone know what matters to you 
### politics is about communication, solving problem

### life and death depends on politics.
