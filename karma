what is karma, 
anything that is done, in any shape or form, 
everything comes under umbrella of karma, 
each karma gives some result,
result are very often unpredictable, 
scope of karma is so large, that pretty much anything can be said of it 
and I can find cases ( so far have found ) where it works 
and where it does not works 

when situtation is simple it is possible to predict the outcome 
then we can say good leads to good and bad lead to bad 
but there are equal number of cases where bad leads to good and vice versa 

there are cases, where what we call good becomes bad , 
and what we were thinking bad becomes good, 

value associated with  each karma can vary dramatically, 

each  karma is unique, as I belive that entire world is chaotic and connected. 
each karma impact everything, but we can't think of everything so we analyse it 
within a context. that's all. 

doing karma is absolutly neccessary  and unavoidable. 
and effortless,  
something is always happening
