# Individual solutions to Collective problems  in social context.
There is just so much cruelty going on the world, open the news, just look around, it is undeniable, 
Some believe that it is just the nature of things, to  a great extent this is true, 
but it is not universaly true, 
Here the truth,We live in the world we create, ( We the people ) 
everything we do influences us and around us, these influence  combines with what others have done 
and return to us , eventually, 
time and the way of return can't be predicted for most siutation as they are too complicated to analyse.
for simple cases, it is easy to see, good deeds return good deeds but bad deed return bad deeds 

but for complicated cases, good can return bad , vice versa
we have tendeciey to wishful thinking and justify our stupidity instead of 
seeing the things as it is, 
and if we are not able to see, them simpliy accepting we don't know, 

# Conceding to goodness of individual, 
At no point, I am claiming that inidividual actions are meaningless, individual poeple doing good work is always welcome, they are essenstial part of progress but not the whole,
but there is a limit that they have, and more they focus on individual action to try to allieviate problem , in fact they take  away possiblity of collective action,

# here is an example,( of collective  punishment  ) 
I have lived in city of banaras for two years, I don't know if each part   this story is true but  I am quite confidant that it is mostly true.
A person dies at age 34 due to heart attack and organ failure, leaving his wife and a baby boy  in  great deal of distress
/ his wife and boy, will be for sure having a difficult time ahead. 
what caused his death? and 
he was not caring enough for his health,
he had liquer and tobacco problem,  
why did he had those problem, like the most people, he job and personal life was miserable, 
so he was indeed more susecptible to addiction 
The fact that he was drinking polluted ground water for years, 
The fact that there free psychiatric and  physical healthcare is poor and expensive, 
The fact he himself was not  thinker or very smart, or did not put effort to learn what life is all about. 
when we look at all these factor, his doesn't seem that culpable, 
that is my point, everyone is responsibly for thier life regardless of enviornment. 
but role of enviornment just can't be under estimated, 
if enviorment is perticular challenging which is the case for most people, 
most poeple will suffer just like this and they won't even understand why 
I don't believe consolation of any short can help. 
they must understand thier misery and grieve on it.
