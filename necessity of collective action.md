# Individual solutions to Collective problems  in social context.
There is just so much cruelty going on the world, open the news, just look around, it is undeniable, 
Some believe that it is just the nature of things, to  a great extent this is true, 
but it is not universaly true, 
Here the truth,We live in the world we create, ( We the people ) 
everything we do influences us and around us, these influence  combines with what others have done 
and return to us , eventually, 
time and the way of return can't be predicted for most siutation as they are too complicated to analyse.
for simple cases, it is easy to see, good deeds return good deeds but bad deed return bad deeds 

but for complicated cases, good can return bad , vice versa
we have tendeciey to wishful thinking and justify our stupidity instead of 
seeing the things as it is, 
and if we are not able to see, them simpliy accepting we don't know, 

# Conceding to goodness of individual, 
At no point, I am claiming that inidividual actions are meaningless, individual poeple doing good work is always welcome, they are essenstial part of progress but not the whole,
but there is a limit that they have, and more they focus on individual action to try to allieviate problem , in fact they take  away possiblity of collective action,

# here is an example,( collective  punishment  ) 
I have lived in city of banaras for two years, I don't know if each part   this story is true but  I am quiite confidant that it is mostly true.
A person dies at age 34 due to heart attack and organ failure, leaving his wife and a baby boy  in  great deal of distress, life of great distress leaving his wife and familty in great distress.
