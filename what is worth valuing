There is no effort involved when we do what we value, 
That is why it is one of the things necessary to understand what is worth valuing

Feeling of struggle comes naturally, but there are two kinds of struggle 
,one in which I am thinking and understanding what is worth valuing , 
I am taking and leaving, attaching and detaching from various ideas and concepts 

There is another kind of struggle, when I find something utterly useless 
But I have to do it in order to survive, 

There are inherent values and derived values ( just  for sake the classifying ,the value is overarching concept of  psyche, it is not separate just like oldness there is not fix number , but difference is clear ) 

Conflict of values/ interest, I am talking about values not told to us ,what we deeply believe 
And act instinctively according to it, 

The way we live depend on what we value as individual and as society 
 Scientific Progress, suffering , material and spiritual well being very much depends upon it

The point is most people including myself seems  to be deeply unaware of this, 
They includeing myself have  never critically analyzed what are they valuing 
Why they are valuing it 
How comes they started valuing whatever they are valuing right now 
Was it their conscious / attentive choice, 
Is it even worth valuing 
 
what  are values worth to hold and why, 

It is absolute necessity to work out this question sooner or later in life 
as it is a fact,When we do what we value it becomes effortless, Imagine  having clear values, how effortless life will become.
Because these values make  up society and economics, 
Which I will discuss   in later chapters 
How the deeply held human values leads to  a particular form of society and economics

Which reinforces itself, 
It always requires lot of effort to see all this, 
But I think it worth the struggle 
Given there is just one life

In indian tradition there is concept of “purushartha”
Which mean things that individual must strive to do, 
There are terrible bad things cruelty  associated with each tradition 
But this concept is worth considering

But this is  real job to people who think , they must refine and define what is worth
 valuing in Life and why 

 in the end the let the people decide for themselves , what they want to value something

based the values that people takes, societal values  will form 
And they will endure their choices , good and bad 

**How do values form**
As we grow up, we take information from people , we trust blindly and lot of that information is wrong or not suitable, 
Based on th
**Here are the things I have found to be valuable **

What is truth what do we mean by it, 

Valuing truth is absolutely  critical, 
I am convinced that those who don’t value in seeing the truth of existence 
As it is, 
Nothing in the world can save them, they are doomed from the start 
But I am not saying them to value the truth, because I understand 
Why someone would not want to see this immensity of existence,
