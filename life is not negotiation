Life is more beautiful than we can imagine together, 
It’s beauty exceeds everything I can say or write or do, 
By the beauty I do not mean only things that give pleasure, 
Things that are brutal beyond what is explicable, 
To see all this , just to see , all this happening 
Of which self , the observer is, and whatever is happening 
Is just extraordinarily mundane and yet extraordinarily new, 

I really can’t say what one should do, how one should live life 
I am really clueless, I am really really confused 

Based on everything that I see, 
There are certain patterns that are obvious, 

One must see  life in its totality, 
One must live life in its totality, 

Whether one is  free  to do so or not, at this point is meaningless 
In bhagvat geeta, krishna says, life is war , and 
I could not disagree more, 
Earlier I had disagreement thinking life is so amazing how could , 
War is extremely brutal word to describe life,
Now I think it is not brutal enough, 

Immense things are happening right now, 
Immense things are ending right now, 

How do we live, the question remains so burning, 
I can discuss question of identity, 
How our indentity is formed  and how it   directs our actions 
And how this is nothing but ending every moment

All life is connected, In this ranting I want to describe everything 
How everything is happening, 
From formation of identity and observer or writer 
To existing material condition / economic and spiritual condition of 
Current situation, 
What needs to be done, 
And what are the things writer and the reader can do,
