life and education goes togather not in the sense, 
that one has to learn in order to live , to do something 
rather learning which becomes part of the identity 
and this learning can come only whne it is true 
One of the beauty of the truth is that 
that is no conflict involved  in accepting it 
Emotions, actions  everything changes after the realisation of the truth 
for example if one knows 2+2 =4,  not a  memory , not through  authority , not thorugh trust on teacher, 
becaseu all these things can break
but understand is as very concept of counting is involved. 
which most people do understand
one would not waste even imagination in thinking, it could be anything else 
such is the nature of truth,
