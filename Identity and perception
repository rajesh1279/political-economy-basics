I am where is my awareness is, 
In fact I am my awareness, 
Imagine a light, the shines in the dark room 
Where ever light goes that part is illuminated and identified as 
Self, 

Now imagine that only what is illuminated, only that exist, 
And there is no conception, 
Of objects outside the illumination of light 

I am what I am doing, 
what I am  and what I am doing when it is not dual, in nature
Observer becomes observed, 

Else there is an observer , resisting and supporting whatever is done 

What are words but just pictures 

There is no me, beyond what I am doing 
And it is a fact, 

There is no such thing as I could have done something different than what I am doing right 
now 

There is no such thing as whatever I have done, I could have done any differently, 

And it is a fact, 
And it is the essence of “what is” 

Self dies at each moments and says I havent died yet 
Self is center of the movement , doing this or that, 
Self is not the total awareness but self comes as a result 
Lack of total intention to living 

And it is natural for self to come into existence and die out of existence 

With the existence of world, entire world of words and concepts , everything we collectively  have 
Springs suddenly into existence
Come into existence , out of sea of consciousness , 
Sea of consciousness is total consciences , total subjective experience of universe 

All that is I am saying goes beyond the notion of physics as understood currently
And it does not contradict anything that science says, 
But point to scientific process and perception 
Let me explain this point, with an example  which will give you some idea 

Imagine two child  born, both capable to perceive the color , 
One is color blind while other is not , 
It is clear that both are saying the same object but perceiving it differently 
At this point childs have no ability  , to talk or anything , even to think in words 

From the perspective of these two childs, they are indeed perceived to different things 
And they would not agree if they could talk 

We, the third grown up person, who is showing them object knows it is the same object 
We know physics , concept of wavelength and light so we can say that object is indeed the same, 

As these child grow up and they touch things , they smell things , they can say things 
In their brain connection are building  , to correlate such perception, 
Now they are touch the same thing , on shape they can agree because they have no problem in their hand, ie hand are similar , so they develop the same perception of touching and length , 
Related concepts 

Eventually they learn about physics, and now once the object that was directly describe by color perception, now can be described in term of wavelength and so on 

Now they they both can agree that object is indeed same, though still are still perceived as before 

Each observer has some internal structure (representation )  when it is born 
This internal structure  is totally unknown to observer
Observer perceive the world directly , in a sense that whatever is perceived becomes part of observer
Different observers  find some  common perceptions , 
Based on these common perception, uncommon perception  is explained and communicated 

This process happens over and over, until all observers  perceive their internal structure as
Combination of invariant of all observers 

These invariant are atom and law of physics and so on 

Which are common to all observers but are not directly perceived by any 
And all observers are now defined in terms of these invariants

It is possible to have same perception but different representation in brain,  
For eg 
Zero car and zero table are conceptually different because we can understand the units 
Bt perception wise that are same 
Zero does exit in reality but it is the common feature of so many perception 


Likewise, it is possible to have representation wise same concept but different actual object 
Imagine image the toy snake vs image of real snake,( of toy snake looks real) 

What we call identity is formed like ship of thesaurus, build by whatever we get on the way, 
But this way is  not just one lifetime ,it is the entire evolutionary journey   before it, 
Include all the impact of environments 
These identity is communicated by using invariant concepts that remain unchanged during the evolutions or upbringing process.
